            <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole.PUBG is one of the best-selling, highest-grossing and most-played video games of all time.The game is about being the last man standing on a virtual island, where you and 99 others are dropped from a fighter plane. These 99 opponents are not internet bots but real people joining from across the world. Unlike other online battle games, PUBG starts with a casual playback and becomes serious difficulty later.</p>
